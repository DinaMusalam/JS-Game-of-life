	<p class="a">The “Game of Life” is a simulation of cellular automatons that demonstrates that complex patterns can emerge from simple rules.
		Evolution of the simulation is determined by the initial state of the simulation and progresses forward.
	</p>
	<ul><p>The rules that drive the simulation are as follows:</p>
		<div class="moreInfo"><li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
		<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
		<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
		<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li></div>
